# System Programming Code Samples
This repo currently is only a showcase of code sample I wrote for the CS341 class. 

You can't execute these files in this repo now because there's no makefile nor header files. Since I didn't write the makefile and the header file I don't want to get into copyrights troubles. 

You're welcome to execute these on online c compilers tho (◕ܫ◕).
